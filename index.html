    <h2>Setting up workspace</h2>
   <p>I took a screenshot of my newly created folder (titled ArchOSC Assignment) for lab 2 <br>including a clear showcase of the path to reach said folder and the contents inside.</p>

    <h2>Create local depository </h2>
    <p>Then I opened my folder within the terminal (directly through folder) before using the<br>git init command to create a local repository allowing me to edit my work in an<br>external environment</p>

   <h2>Making Github repository</h2>
   <p>After creating a repository locally, I then had to create a second repository on GitHub<br>in order to create a place for me to push any edits made locally, following the<br>restrictions required(added ReadMe and .gitignore)</p>

   <h2>Connecting repositories</h2>
   <p>Now that I have both repositories, I now must create the link between the 2. In order<br>to this I opened my workspace folder in the terminal and used commands “git remote <br>add origin”  and “git pull origin main” to connect the 2 allowing me to copy any<br> changes made on one repository to the other </p>

    <h2>Basic website</h2>
    <p>Now both repositories are linked I now started my first project, creating a simple<br> website. I did this in visual studio code using the html code provided in the lab work  </p>

    <h2>Saving locally</h2>
    <p>Now this website is done I must first save it to the local repository. I did this using<br> commands “git add .” and “git status” throughout to get a colour coordinated<br> response showing which files are and are not saved .</p>

    <h1></h1>


    <h2>Pushing to GitHub repository</h2>
    <p>Now that its locally saved I must now push it to my online repository on GitHub. I did <br>this back in terminal using command “git push -u origin main” to push all changes<br> and “git commit -m “….”” To write a brief description of what changes have been<br> made </p>

    <h2>Website Changes and pushing to GitHub</h2>
        <p>Finally, I now made 2 edits to my original website before repeating the process to push <br>these edits to my GitHub repository.</p>

    <h3>Edit 1</h3>
    <p>Changed the text from “Insert name here” simply to my name by editing the <br>text within the <br> tag  </p>

    <h3>Edit 2</h3>
    <p>Changed the background colour from white to red to make it visually brighter by editing line <br>“background-color:..…”</p>

    <h3>Setup of GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>Within here i now set up my GitHub pages to allow me to access my website through the GitHub repository .To do this i first had to make the repository public before making the appropriate changes to allow for my website to now be hosted on github pages along with my github repository</p>

    <h1>-----Reflection----- </h1>
    <p>Within this lab session i learnt how to more efficiently use the command prompt to make links between <br>a local repository and a Github repository.I believe this was very helpful as it means my work becomes <br>alot easier to save in future . Along with this i also practiced my html and css coding<br><br>I believe these aquired skills would be helpful in the workplace as it allows for easy collaborative work<br> across a GitHub repository allowing people to work on their own projects without affecting the work of those<br> around them before pushing only the finished ,working result .>
